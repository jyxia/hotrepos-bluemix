## Overview
This is [HotRepos](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1142465304?mt=8) iOS App's web landing (marketing) page. The webpage is now a **React** web app deployed on Bluemix, and the link is: http://hotrepos.mybluemix.net/. The webpage is responsive, you can change the screen size to notice the changes.

## Deploy to Bluemix
* Just simply click this magic button.

  [![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Or, use _*cf cli*_ to push this app to Bluemix manually.
  * clone this repo to your computer.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/jyxia/hotrepos-bluemix.git
  ```
    
  * `cd` navigate to _*hotrepos-bluemix*_ directory
  * open [_manifest.yml_](./manifest.yml) change `name` and `host` to 'you_app_name'.
  * run
  ```
  cf push
  ```

  > **Note:** Above instructions are assuming you have installed _cf cli_ on your computer and have a Bluemix account. If you don't have any, create [Bluemix account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/) -> Download [cf cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) -> Setup [cf tool](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/cfcommands/index.html) and login Bluemix with _cf cli_ (see [Bluemix login](#bluemix-login)).

## Run the app locally
* Clone this repo to your computer (`git clone`).
* `cd` into the app directory (_hotrepos-bluemix_).
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Start the development (dev mode)
  1. run  
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
    You will see this line on your terminal
    ```
    ==> ðŸŒŽ  Listening on port 6001. Open up http://localhost:6001 in your browser.
    ```

    > ** Note:** `cfenv` might assign you a different port (other than 6001), just use the port number shown on the terminal. In this instruction, I'll just use the `cfenv` default port number (6001).

  2. open up [http://localhost:6001](http://localhost:6001) in your browser of choice.
* Start the production (prod mode)
  1. run
  ```
  npm run build
  ```
    Production files are all generated into [dist](./dist).
  2. wait until `webpack` finishes building all files, then run the web server (production server)
  ```
  npm run web-server
  ```
  3. navigate to [http://localhost:6001](http://localhost:6001) in the browser. Again, your port number might be different than 6001.

* If you want to lint your code,
  ```
  npm run lint
  ```
* If you want to clean `dist`,
  ```
  npm run clean
  ```
    
* If you have made changes to the code and want to **deploy to Bluemix**,
  ```
  npm build
  ```
    
  after the build is finished,
  ```
  cf push
  ```

> **Note:** In `dev` mode, `redux-logger` and webpack hot modules are included for development purpose. In `build` or `prod` mode, these dev tools are removed and `dist` folder gets cleaned every time.

## Development Tools
#### JS framework: React
* See [src](./src) folder for the code and the project structure.
* `Redux` is only used to demonstrate my Redux skill. Although a lot of React components are created, there are not many states changes in the components. This is really a very static page.

#### CSS
* [`bootstrap`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) is used for the css framework (only bootstrap.css is used).
  * The page is fully responsive. Please try.
* [`autoprefixer`](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) takes care of `css` prefixers across different browsers.

#### Web server
* Host the webpages and static files, particularly HotRepos iOS app's screenshots that are displayed on the webpage.
* Use `Express` to create a simply backend API for retrieving the `urls` of screenshot images (image file paths).
  * `/api/images` is the route.

  > **Note:** Doing this is only for demonstrating the *`actions` and `states` changes* in `Redux` on the client side. In real life, probably, you don't want to do like this.

#### Babel and Linting
* Babel: transpile ES6 to ES5.
* Use *eslint* to make sure the code is linted. Here [.eslintrc](./eslintrc) is the list of rules that are used in this project.

## Dependencies
All dependencies are declared in [package.json](./package.json). Special thanks to *MIT-licenced* React components: [react-slick](https://github.com/akiran/react-slick) (for the "slide show"), and [react-scroll](https://github.com/fisshy/react-scroll) (for "scroll to top").
